## Part 1 - How They Work
### 1.1 Easy  for  Me,  Hard  for  You
| Problem | Computer | Human |
| :- | :-: | :-: |
| Millions of calculations | X | |
| Image detection | | X |

### 1.2 A Simple Predicting Machine 
Every Process / Model _(Model is just the mathemadical name for Process)_ has an input and an output. If we don't know the process than we can quess it.  

`Input 100 --> Process ??? --> Output 59,491`

we could guess that the Process is the calculation X0.6. `100 x0.6 = 60`

`59,291 - 60 = -0.709` <-- this is how much our process is wrong.

Now we can try a better quess. Let's try X0.59. `100 * 0.59 = 59`

`59.291 - 59 = 0.291` we get closer but we are not there yet.

We now know that the exact process is in between x0.59 and x0.60. The more quesses we take the closer we getto the real process. But we probably will never exaclty hit the Process.
